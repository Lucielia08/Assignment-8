# Assignment 8

# What to do for this assignment:

- [ ]  Create a button
- [ ]  Give the button an ID
- [ ]  Put an emoji between the button's opening and closing tags
- [ ]  Use JavaScript to target the button using it's ID by using getElementById (See website https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById) and store it into a variable
- [ ]  Use the .onclick to assign a function to the button that determines what it'll do when it's clicked (example: mybutton.onclick = doSomething)
- [ ]  Create a new function that you'll assign to the button's onclick functionality
  - [ ]  The function must contain an array of emojis
  - [ ]  The function must change the button's innerHTML to a random emoji select from the emoji array (example: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_html_innerhtml.asp)
- [ ]  Test that clicking the button changes the emoji
